\chapter*{Preface}

This book is written as a handbook for economists rather than a note for courses like Econ Math, where materials are selected from various sources including course handouts from SUFE, lecture notes from open scources and many great books. 
To make it a comprehensive one, I'll try to cover almost all maths needed for studying economics, including logic, algebra, analysis, topology, probability theory and the theory of optimization. 
And I'll add something more, basically based on the syllabus of the course I've taken. In this way can those(especially from SUFE) who're taking courses like Mathematical analysis refer to it.

Though served as a handbook, the book will be written as intuitive as possible so that all techniques and definitions are expressed in a natural way and readers can better understand them.

The book may be updated in a monthly basis.
