\chapter*{Acknowledgement}
This book is written using \LaTeX. The template is based on Agni Datta's \href{https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/preprint-book-manuscript-template/ghrbwppzhzjx}{"Preprint Book Manuscript Template"}, which I have modified to fit my requirements. 
The famous \href{https://github.com/ElegantLaTeX/ElegantLaTeX}{ElegantLaTeX} template has also inspired me greatly. The source code is available in \href{https://github.com/guo-zhenran/Maths-for-Economists}{my GitHub repository} for reference.

I would like to thank Copilot and DeepSeek for helping me write and edit this book.
