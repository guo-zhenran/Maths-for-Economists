\chapter{Set, Relation and Operation}
Since all readers should be familiar with the high-school-level set theory, we only give a brief review of the basic concepts and operations of sets.

We can't define what is a set but we can give it a description. A set is all objects that satisfy a certain property. The following lists some of the basics.

\begin{definition}[Subset]
    Let $A,B$ be sets, when we say $A \subset B$, we mean $\forall x \in A, x \in B$. Notice $$A = B \iff (A\subset B) \land (B \subset A)$$
\end{definition}
